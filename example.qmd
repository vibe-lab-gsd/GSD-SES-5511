## Setup

### Software installation

1.  Download and install:

    -   R (<https://cran.rstudio.com/>)

    -   RStudio (<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>)

    -   Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 (<https://adoptium.net/>)

2.  Install the following packages within R:

    -   tidyverse

    -   sf

    -   r5r

    -   here

    -   knitr

    -   tidytransit

### Data

1.  Create a project folder.

2.  Create an RStudio project with that project folder.

3.  Save this Quarto file to your RStudio project folder.

4.  Navigate to <https://github.com/vibe-lab-gsd/GSD-SES-5511/tree/main/network-files> and choose a study area from among the directories you see listed there.

5.  Open that directory and download all the files you find there.

6.  Create a subfolder called "network-files" in your project folder. Save the files you just downloaded to that subfolder.

7.  Navigate your browser to <https://github.com/vibe-lab-gsd/GSD-SES-5511/tree/main/locations>, download the geojson file corresponding to your study area, and save it to your project directory.

## Load packages

Run the following code to allocate 2 gigabytes of memory to Java and load the libraries you'll be using.

```{r}
options(java.parameters = '-Xmx2G')  

library(tidyverse) 
library(sf) 
library(r5r) 
library(here)
library(knitr)
library(tidytransit)
```

## Initialize R5

Run this code to set up an R5 core you will use for subsequent calculations.

```{r}
my_core <- here("network-files",
                "El-Paso-TX") |>
  setup_r5()
```

## Map network

We can make a quick map of the study area. We'll start by creating a layer of streets, a layer of transit routes, and a layer of transit stops from the network data.

```{r}
streets <- street_network_to_sf(my_core)$edges

transit <- transit_network_to_sf(my_core)

routes <- transit$routes
stops <- transit$stops
```

The transit network might cover a larger area than the street network, and the street network might include some areas that aren't served by transit at all, so we'll define a bounding box around the transit network and a bounding box around the street network and define our study area as the area that those two boxes overlap.

```{r}
routes_bbox <- st_bbox(routes)
streets_bbox <- st_bbox(streets)

area <- st_intersection(st_as_sfc(routes_bbox), 
                                st_as_sfc(streets_bbox))

```

Now, we'll filter out routes, stops, and streets to only include what's in that study area.

```{r}
area_routes <- st_intersection(routes, area)

area_stops <- st_intersection(stops, area) |>
  rename(id = stop_id)

area_streets <- st_intersection(streets, area) |>
  st_cast("MULTILINESTRING")
```

And we can create a quick map of the routes, stops, and streets in our study area.

```{r}
ggplot(area_streets) +
  geom_sf(color = "gray") +
  geom_sf(data = area_routes,
          color = "red") +
  geom_sf(data = area_stops,
          color = "blue",
          size = 1) +
  theme_void()
```

The following code will save the above map as a png file.

```{r}
here("network-map.png") |>
  ggsave(width = 6, height = 6, units = "in", dpi = 600)
```

## Map stop frequencies

As we've discussed, the presence of a stop is less relevant than the presence of frequent transit service. We can map the stops by how frequently they are served. The tidytransit package has a function called `get_stop_frequency` that will read the GTFS file and calculate the number of departures from each stop within a specified time window.

First we need to find the GTFS file in the networks folder. Here, I'm getting a list of all the file in the directory, and making a separate list of those that are zip files (these will be the GTFS files).

```{r}
network_file_list <- list.files(path = here("network-files",
                                           "El-Paso-TX"),
                               full.names = FALSE)

gtfs_files <- network_file_list[str_detect(network_file_list, ".zip")]

```

Now, I want to read the first GTFS feed in my list and calculate the stop frequencies. A couple quirks: tidytransit's `read_gtfs` function is leaving off a prefix in the id column that the r5r package leaves in when it reads in stop locations, so in this specific case of El Paso, I'm adding it back in. You may not need to do this specific thing (`mutate(id = paste0("google_transit:", stop_id))`) for your study area.

Also, the `get_stop_frequency` function returns a separate frequency for each route, so you'll want to use `group_by` and `summarize` to collapse your data to the stop level.

The `head()` and `kable()` functions below are just so I can show you the first few rows of the resulting table.

```{r}
gtfs_data_1 <- read_gtfs(here("network-files",
                                       "El-Paso-TX",
                                       gtfs_files[1]))

stop_freq <- get_stop_frequency(gtfs_data_1, 
                                start_time = "17:00:00",
                                end_time = "18:00:00") |>
  mutate(id = paste0("google_transit:", stop_id)) |>
  group_by(id) |>
  summarize(n_departures = sum(n_departures)) 

head(stop_freq) |>
  kable()


```

Now we can add those frequencies to our layer of stops. Stops that have no service during the study period will have missing values, so I'll replace those NA values with zeros. I'll also calculate a categorical frequency variable just for visualization purposes.

```{r}
area_stops <- left_join(area_stops, stop_freq) |>
  replace_na(list(n_departures = 0)) |>
  mutate(freq_cat = case_when(n_departures == 1 ~ "60-minute headways",
                              n_departures == 2 ~ "30-minute headways",
                              n_departures == 3 ~ "20-minute headways",
                              n_departures == 4 ~ "15-minute headways",
                              n_departures > 4 ~ "Less than 15-minute headways",
                              TRUE ~ "No service from 5pm to 6pm"))


```

Now I can make a quick map showing how the frequency varies among stops.

```{r}
ggplot(area_stops) +
  geom_sf(data = area_stops,
          size = 1,
          aes(color = freq_cat)) +
  scale_color_brewer(name = "Service frequency",
                     type = "qual") +
  theme_void()
```

## Map locations

We can also read in the centroids (points in the middle) of census blocks within the study area, display them on a map.

We'll be filtering them to only include blocks that contain a non-zero number of households and/or jobs.

```{r}
blocks <- here("locations",
               "El-Paso-TX-blocks.geojson") |>
  st_read(quiet = TRUE) |>
  st_filter(area) |>
  filter(total_emp > 0,
         n_HHs > 0 )
```

This layer of blocks includes the following attributes:

-   **total_emp:** the total number of jobs in each block.

-   **retail_emp:** the total number of retail jobs in each block.

-   **service_emp:** the total number of service jobs in each block.

-   **basic_emp:** the total number of jobs that are not retail or service jobs in each block.

-   **n_HHs:** The number of households living in each block.

-   **hbw_attr:** The estimated demand for "home-based work" trips (trips between home and work) that would be to/from each block (estimated as 1.2 times the total number of jobs in the block, based on NCHRP 716[^1]).

-   **hbo_attr:** The estimated demand for "home-based other" trips (trips other than home-based work trips that begin or end at home) that would be to/from this block (estimated as 0.7 times the number of households plus 0.7 times basic employment plus 8.4 times retail employment plus 3.5 times service employment, based on NCHRP 716).

-   **nhb_attr:** The estimated demand for "non-home-based" trips (those that do not begin or end at home) that would be to/from this block (estimated as 0.6 times the number of households plus 0.5 times basic employment plus 4.7 times retail employment plus 1.4 times service employment, based on NCHRP 716).

-   **total_attr:** The estimated total demand for trips to/from this block.

[^1]: <https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/14665/travel-demand-forecasting-parameters-and-techniques>

Here's a map that shows the variation in demand for travel to/from locations throughout the study area (transit routes are also shown for context).

```{r}
ggplot(area_routes) +
  geom_sf(color = "red") +
  geom_sf(data = blocks,
          aes(size = total_attr,
              alpha = total_attr)) +
  scale_alpha(name = "Estimate daily trips") +
  scale_size(name = "Estimate daily trips") +
  theme_void()
```

I'll save that map as a .png file.

```{r}
here("demand-map.png") |>
  ggsave(width = 6, height = 6, units = "in", dpi = 600)
```

## Calculate accessibility to transit

You can calculate accessibility using the `accessibility()` function in the r5r package. You will need to specifify the following parameters:

-   `r5r_core`: The core you created in the "Initialize R5" section.

-   `origins`: The locations for which you want to generate an accessibility score.

-   `destinations`: The locations you want to calculate access to.

-   `opportunities_colnames`: An attribute/variable of the destinations layer that indicates the weight of each destination (e.g. how many destinations are at each location).

-   `decay_function`: A function that determines how to weight a destination based on how far it is from the origin. Can be "step", "logistic", "linear", or "exponential." See <https://urban-stack.shinyapps.io/access-decay/>

-   `cutoff`: The first parameter defining the decay function (see <https://urban-stack.shinyapps.io/access-decay/>).

-   `decay_value`: The second parameter defining the decay function (if there is a second), See <https://urban-stack.shinyapps.io/access-decay/>

-   `mode`: The mode of transportation. Can be "WALK", "CAR", or "TRANSIT". If the mode is "TRANSIT", you should also specify the following parameters:

    -   `departure_datetime`: What time and day you are calculating accessibility for.

    -   `time_window`: Accessibility will be calculated at one-minute intervals during a window. If you want to median accessibility over a one-hour period, beginning at your specified time, set this to 60, for 60 minutes.

    -   `percentiles`: By default, you will get the median accessibility for the period defined by the departure time and time window, but you can also get other points in the distribution.

### Accessibility to transit

#### Access to households from stops

Here is how you would calculate the number of households within a 10-minute walk of each transit stop in your study area.

```{r}
access_to_transit_1 <- accessibility(r5r_core = my_core,
                                   origins = area_stops,
                                   destinations = blocks,
                                   opportunities_colnames = "n_HHs",
                                   mode = "WALK",
                                   decay_function = "step",
                                   cutoffs = 10)

head(access_to_transit_1) |>
  kable()
```

Now we can join those results to our stops layer and see the number of households served by each stop.

```{r}
area_stops <- area_stops |>
  left_join(access_to_transit_1)

ggplot(area_stops) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = accessibility)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(trans = "log",
                        name = "Number of\nhouseholds within\n10-minute walk",
                        breaks = c(5, 50, 500)) +
  theme_void()
```

And I can save that map.

```{r}
here("stops-access.png") |>
  ggsave(width = 6, height = 6, units = "in", dpi = 600)
```

#### Access to departures from blocks/households

Another measure of accessibility to transit would be the number of transit departures within a ten-minute walk from each census block.

```{r}
access_to_transit_2 <- accessibility(r5r_core = my_core,
                                   origins = blocks,
                                   destinations = area_stops,
                                   opportunities_colnames = "n_departures",
                                   mode = "WALK",
                                   decay_function = "step",
                                   cutoffs = 10)

head(access_to_transit_2) |>
  kable()
```

And now I can map those:

```{r}
blocks <- blocks |>
  left_join(access_to_transit_2)

ggplot(blocks) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = accessibility)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(trans = "log",
                        name = "Number of bus \ndepartures within\na 10-minute walk",
                        breaks = c(1, 10, 100)) +
  theme_void()
```

### Accessibility by transit

Here is how you would calculate the median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile number of trip attractions that are accessible from each census block with a 30-minute transit commute during the 5pm hour on Wednesday, February 28, 2024.

You'll end up with a table with the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile accessibility for each census block.

```{r}
access_by_transit <- accessibility(r5r_core = my_core,
                                   origins = blocks,
                                   destinations = blocks,
                                   opportunities_colnames = "total_attr",
                                   mode = "TRANSIT",
                                   decay_function = "step",
                                   cutoffs = 30,
                                   departure_datetime = 
                                   as.POSIXct("28-02-2024 17:00:00",
                                              format = "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S"),
                                   time_window = 60,
                                   percentiles = c(25, 50, 75))

head(access_by_transit) |>
  kable()
```

It will be helpful to rearrange this table so that there is one row for each census block and the different accessibility value for each percentile is in a different column.

```{r}
access_by_transit <- access_by_transit |>
  select(id, percentile, accessibility) |>
  pivot_wider(id_cols = "id",
              names_from = percentile,
              names_prefix = "access_pctile_",
              values_from = accessibility)

head(access_by_transit) |>
  kable()
```

Now we can join this to our layer of census block centroids and see how access by transit varies across the study area.

```{r}
blocks <- blocks |>
  left_join(access_by_transit)

ggplot(blocks) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = access_pctile_50),
          size = 1) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(trans = "log",
                        name = "Median accessibilty\nto destinations",
                        breaks = c(20, 200, 2000, 20000)) +
  theme_void()
```

And I can save that map.

```{r}
here("block-access.png") |>
  ggsave(width = 6, height = 6, units = "in", dpi = 600)
```

## Stop R5

Once you're done with your calculations, you can stop R5, which will release the memory it's using.

```{r}
stop_r5()
```

## Save data

You might want to work with this data using other GIS software. Here is how you would save all this data to an ESRI geodatabase.

```{r}
st_write(area_stops, 
         dsn = here("el-paso.gdb"),
         layer = "stops",
         quiet = TRUE,
         append = FALSE)

st_write(area_routes, 
         dsn = here("el-paso.gdb"),
         layer = "routes",
         quiet = TRUE,
         append = FALSE)

st_write(area_streets, 
         dsn = here("el-paso.gdb"),
         layer = "streets",
         quiet = TRUE,
         append = FALSE)

st_write(blocks, 
         dsn = here("el-paso.gdb"),
         layer = "blocks",
         quiet = TRUE,
         append = FALSE)
```

And here is how I would save the data in the blocks and stops files as csv files (without the geospatial data).

```{r}
area_stops |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  write_csv(file = here("stops_access.csv"))

blocks |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  write_csv(file = here("blocks_access.csv"))
```
